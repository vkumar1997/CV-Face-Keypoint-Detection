# CV-Face-Keypoint-Detection
Face Detection using Haar Cascade Classifier and Convolutional Neural Network

Hello, This is a home-project on facial keypoints detection (important points on a human face which can be used for automatic detection of faces using computer vision). So, lets start.

This task has three parts
* Detecting faces and eyes using Haar Cascade
* Building a CNN to detect facial keypoints
* Combining the two tasks to build a face detector

Please see the Jupyter Notebook to understand  the project in detail
